# Feature Specification: Development Environment Checker

**Feature Branch**: `001-sds-macos-linux`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "∞É¡ß√Ø¨§…ƒ¸Î - A tool to check development environments on macOS/Linux, detect missing/outdated tools, and provide official documentation links without performing installations"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a company developer receiving a new computer or joining a new project, I want to quickly verify that my development environment has all required tools with correct versions, so I can identify what needs to be installed and get official links to do so myself, without the tool attempting potentially destructive installations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a development machine with some required tools installed, **When** I run the environment checker, **Then** I see a clear report showing which tools are OK, which are missing, and which are outdated with their current versions
2. **Given** tools that are missing from my system, **When** the checker completes, **Then** I receive official download links and documentation for each missing tool
3. **Given** tools that are installed but outdated, **When** the checker runs, **Then** I see what version I have, what version is required, and links to upgrade
4. **Given** I need machine-readable output for CI integration, **When** I run the checker with a JSON flag, **Then** I receive structured data about all tool statuses
5. **Given** my organization has specific tool requirements, **When** the checker runs, **Then** it uses the company-standard manifest to determine what should be checked

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a tool command exists but returns unexpected output format?
- How does system handle network connectivity issues when fetching remote manifests?
- What if a tool version cannot be determined from its output?
- How are platform differences (macOS vs Linux) handled for the same logical tool?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect the presence of development tools by executing version commands
- **FR-002**: System MUST compare detected tool versions against semantic version requirements
- **FR-003**: System MUST categorize each tool as OK, missing, outdated, or error state
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide human-readable output showing tool status with rationale
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide machine-readable JSON output for automated processing
- **FR-006**: System MUST display official links (homepage, downloads, documentation) for problematic tools
- **FR-007**: System MUST support loading tool requirements from YAML manifest files
- **FR-008**: System MUST support both local file and remote URL manifests
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow personal overrides of company-standard manifests
- **FR-010**: System MUST return appropriate exit codes for scripting (0=success, 1=issues found)
- **FR-011**: System MUST support listing all tools defined in the current manifest
- **FR-012**: System MUST operate on macOS and Linux platforms only
- **FR-013**: System MUST timeout tool version checks to prevent hanging
- **FR-014**: System MUST never execute installations or system modifications
- **FR-015**: Tool version detection MUST use regular expressions with named capture groups
- **FR-016**: System MUST merge multiple manifest sources with last-wins precedence
- **FR-017**: System MUST validate semantic version constraints before performing checks

### Key Entities
- **Tool Definition**: Represents a development tool with its name, version requirements, detection commands, and help links
- **Manifest**: A configuration file defining the complete set of tools required for a development environment
- **Check Result**: The outcome of verifying a single tool, including status, version found, and any error messages
- **Environment Report**: A comprehensive summary of all tool checks including platform information and statistics
