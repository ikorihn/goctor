# Research: Development Environment Checker

## Technology Decisions

### Language Choice: Go with Standard Library Only

**Decision**: Go 1.22+ using only standard library packages

**Rationale**:
- Single binary deployment with zero external dependencies
- Excellent cross-platform support (macOS/Linux multiple architectures)
- Strong standard library with built-in YAML support (encoding/yaml)
- Native regex and HTTP client for manifest loading
- Minimal attack surface for enterprise deployment
- Fast compilation and execution suitable for CI environments

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Rust: More complex for simple CLI, longer compilation times
- Python: Requires runtime installation, packaging complexity
- Shell script: Platform differences, limited error handling
- Node.js: Runtime dependency, security concerns for corporate environment

### Semantic Version Handling

**Decision**: Custom semver implementation using Go standard regex

**Rationale**:
- User requirement to avoid external dependencies
- Standard library regex sufficient for semver constraint parsing
- Full control over version comparison logic
- Eliminates dependency on external semver libraries

**Alternatives Considered**:
- github.com/Masterminds/semver/v3: Violates no-dependency requirement
- Basic string comparison: Insufficient for semantic version semantics

### YAML Manifest Format

**Decision**: YAML using encoding/yaml from Go standard library

**Rationale**:
- Human-readable configuration format
- Built-in Go support in encoding/yaml
- Industry standard for configuration files
- Supports complex nested structures for tool definitions

**Alternatives Considered**:
- JSON: Less human-friendly for configuration
- TOML: No standard library support
- INI: Too limited for complex tool definitions

### CLI Architecture Pattern

**Decision**: Command pattern with explicit flag parsing using flag package

**Rationale**:
- User requirement to avoid CLI libraries
- Standard library flag package provides basic CLI functionality
- Clear separation of commands (doctor, list)
- Extensible for future commands

**Alternatives Considered**:
- cobra: External dependency, violates requirements
- Custom argument parsing: Reinventing wheel for complex scenarios

### Cross-Platform Tool Detection

**Decision**: os/exec.Command with platform-specific adjustments

**Rationale**:
- Consistent interface across platforms
- Built-in timeout support via context
- No shell injection vulnerabilities
- Direct command execution without shell interpretation

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Platform-specific shell commands: Security and portability issues
- CGo calls to system APIs: Increases complexity, breaks cross-compilation

### Version Extraction Strategy

**Decision**: Regular expressions with named capture groups

**Rationale**:
- Specified in requirements as mandatory approach
- Flexible parsing for different tool output formats
- Standard library regexp package sufficient
- Configurable per tool in manifest

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Fixed parsing logic: Too rigid for diverse tool formats
- Output line splitting: Unreliable across different tools

### Error Handling Pattern

**Decision**: Explicit error returns with structured error types

**Rationale**:
- Go idiom for explicit error handling
- Allows graceful degradation for individual tool failures
- Clear error categorization (missing, outdated, error states)
- Supports both human and machine-readable error reporting

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Panic-based error handling: Not suitable for CLI tools
- Silent failure: Violates user requirement for clear reporting

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Concurrent tool checking using goroutines for independent tools
- HTTP client timeout configuration for remote manifest loading
- Regex compilation caching for repeated version parsing

### Security Measures
- No arbitrary code execution (shell commands avoided)
- Input validation for manifest URLs and local paths
- Timeout protection against hanging tool commands
- Read-only file system operations

### Testing Strategy
- Table-driven tests for version parsing and comparison
- Mock tool commands for predictable test execution
- Integration tests with real tool commands
- Cross-platform test execution in CI

### Deployment Considerations
- Single binary with embedded default manifest
- Cross-compilation for multiple platforms
- SHA256 checksums for binary integrity verification
- No installation requirements beyond binary placement
